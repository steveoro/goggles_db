  # Typically, in previous versions, this entity stored just the _final team rankings_
  # for a completely ended Season.
  #
  # We aim at reducing real-time computations by providing this serialization space for
  # any hall-of-fame-alike season history & data even for ongoing Seasons (to be updated
  # after each Meeting results acquisition).
